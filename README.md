## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emil

I'm a the maker of Palette and a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture.

- ðŸŽ¥ A one-minute [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPk7tG2upc)
- ðŸ–¼ [The Klimt Color Enigma](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-klimt-color-enigma/SQWxuZfE5ki3mQ?hl=en) ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-reviving-lost-art/) & [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/gustav-klimt-google-digital-reconstructions/2021/12/28/4a18f61e-36a5-11ec-8be3-e14aaacfa8ac_story.html))
- ðŸŽ› An ML desktop browser app to [colorize photos with words](https://palette.fm/).

In 2018, I made a popular open-source project that translates design mock-ups into HTML/CSS, [Screenshot-to-code](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code), and in early 2019 I was the subject for a short-film by Google for my work on [automated colorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPk7tG2upc). 

I used to work for the University of Oxford and co-founded a [seed investment firm](http://emerge.education/) focussed on education technology (59 investments).

## Quirks

- I've lived in Ghana where I volunteered as a teacher and accidentally became the king of the village I lived in. 
- I joined a music group and toured a dozen countries. My highlight was a Spanish solo for 6k Mexicans. (For the record, I'm a terrible singer. I only got the opportunity because the three first options were sick.)
- For a year, I lived as a digital nomad in southeast Asia, the States, and South Africa.
- I run the equivalent of a marathon every week, only wear black, and I own less than a hundred objects. 
- I've participated in a silent retreat and taken several solo trips to remote parts of the world.
