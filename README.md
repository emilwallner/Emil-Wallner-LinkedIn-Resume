Emil is currently exploring code synthesis and deep reinforcement learning. He's studying Computer Science at 42 Paris. In 2018, he made a popular open source project that translates design mock-ups into HTML/CSS, [Screenshot-to-code](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code). 

[His blog](http://medium.com/@emilwallner) is translated to a dozen languages, which reaches over a million developers each year. Emil used to work for Oxford's business school and he started a [seed investment firm](http://emerge.education/) focussed on education technology. 

**Looking for a deep learning engineering/research internship at the end of 2019.**

Open to commissions and collaborations: w@llner.co

## Quirks

- I've lived in Ghana where I volunteered as a teacher and accidentally became the king of the village I lived in. 
- I joined a music group and toured a dozen countries. My highlight was a Spanish solo for 6k Mexicans. (For the record, I'm a terrible singer. I only got the opportunity because the three first options were sick.)
- For a year, I lived as a digital nomad in southeast Asia, the States, and South Africa.
- I run the equivalent of a marathon every week, only wear black, and I own less than a hundred objects. 
- I've participated in a silent retreat and taken several solo trips to remote parts of the world.
